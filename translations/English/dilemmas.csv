#,NATODefense_1,Don't Defend Ally,"We can't afford to bail this ally out, especially when they contribute so little to this alliance. Russia is a powerful country, and it's likely that going to battle here will have major consequences for us. Unfortunately, this time we will not answer the call to action. ",
#,ClearSpaceJunk,Clear Space Junk?,"An international coalition has come up with a plan to remove some of the space junk that currently resides in the Earth's atmosphere. To perform the act, they'll need several space-faring countries to commit to lifting the financial burden necessary. Your country is on the short list of those who are being tapped for assistance. If you agree, this will not be a cheap venture. ", 
#,ClearSpaceJunk_0,Contribute to Space Junk Cleanup,"The space junk will have to be dealt with at some point. We may as well remove it now when other countries are willing to cooperate rather than later. Getting rid of this orbiting junk will decrease the cost of space travel and will make the entire process more feasible, so we should certainly contribute. ",
#,ClearSpaceJunk_1,Don't Contribute to Space Junk,"We can't afford to spend a lumpsum this large on clearing space junk out. We have much more important things to worry about! Besides, we can work around it in our own space travels and make up for it with technology and experience. ",
#,ForeignLunarBase,Foreign Access to Lunar Base?,"Now that we have dedicated resources to building a permanent presence on the moon, foreign countries around the globe are asking for access to our base. This could be to perform experiments, refuel their spacecraft, or any other number of uses. Patriots in our country are saying that they shouldn't have access unless they provide space-related assistance to us. ",
#,ForeignLunarBase_0,Allow Foreign Governments Access,"As humanity ventures into the stars, it's time to put aside the petty notions of nationalism and inter-country-conflict. We would be glad to open our doors (er- airlocks) and greet them with open arms on the lunar surface. ",
#,ForeignLunarBase_1,Don't Allow Foreign Governments Access,"We are going to be spending a huge amount of resources on this lunar base. If other countries want to get the same benefits the base provides, there should be something in it for us. We aren't here to offer free handouts to propel the world into space.",
#,MarsMissionLead,Choose Mars Mission Lead,"As our Mars Program takes off and prepares for a manned mission to the red planet, the question has arisen regarding who we will be sending. There are currently three equally qualified candidates for mission lead. The person that you choose will likely have a large national impact considering the scope of our mission. ",
#,MarsMissionLead_0,Appoint Christine White ,"Christine White has been a part of the Space Program for quite some time now and has already taken part in several space-based scientific discoveries in the past. She is quick to emphasize the importance of working together as a unified planet as we reach towards the stars, and has engaged in numerous humanitarian efforts. ",
#,MarsMissionLead_1,Appoint Victor Martinez,"Victor Martinez has entered into the Space Program after a long-career in the military. Martinez was at the top of his unit, awarded numerous times for outstanding service. Beyond this, he has long been an advocate of traditional values and the country of yester-year, making him popular with conservatives. ",
#,MarsMissionLead_2,Appoint Trever Satterfield,"Trever Satterfield has been involved in ongoing space-missions for the past few years, but not under our national umbrella. They instead have been working for private aerospace firms. Enlisting the help of the private sector's premiere astronaut is sure to show good graces towards the companies that reside in our country. ",
#,SpaceForceGlobal,Abide by Space Demilitarization?,"Several countries around the world have noticed that we are now funneling money into a branch of our military dedicated to space-based projects. The United Nations is now looking to us, asking if we intend on honoring their wishes of keeping space as a demilitarized zone. If we agree, it will make us appear favorable on the world's stage. However, it will also limit the capabilities of our military. ",
#,SpaceForceGlobal_0,Honor Demilitarization Wishes,"It only makes sense to keep space as a peaceful zone. If we open the can of worms that is space-based warfare, there could be an unseen amount of devasation that follows. We will abide by the rules set in place by the UN and make sure that our military presence in space amounts only to a defensive, utilitarian one. ",
#,SpaceForceGlobal_1,Deploy Orbital Military Forces,"Even if we were to agree to keep our military out of space, what would stop any one of our rivals from doing the same? If we are to maintain a permanent presence and foothold in space, there can be no concessions to organizations like the UN. This is a matter of national security and will not to be governed by anyone but us. ",
#,MiddleEastTerror,Covert Strike in Middle East?,"Our intelligence services have pinpointed the location of a terrorist leader in the Middle East. This individual is responsible for numerous attacks that are currently destabilizing governments in the region. Military leadership is pointing out that this is huge opportunity to strike a major blow against these groups. However, we are not sanctioned to conduct military operations in the country they are hiding. ",
#,MiddleEastTerror_0,Authorize Covert Strike,"This is simply too big of an opportunity for us not to act. There will very likely be fallout on the international stage as a result of us deploying troops in this country, but the gains made in both international and regional safety by ending this individual's reign of terror would be well worth it. ",
#,MiddleEastTerror_1,Authorize Strike with Warning,"If we provide a warning to the country they're residing in before sending in our strike team, there will likely be less of a negative reaction on the international stage. However, providing a warning may take time and could result in a situation in which the high-value target moves to a new location or learns of our plans before they're put into action. ",
#,MiddleEastTerror_2,Pass Information Along,"Rather than pursuing the strike against the terror leader ourselves, we could pass the information that we've gained along to the country they're hiding out in. While this will avoid any international ramifications, we won't have direct control over the operation. The responsibility to act is passed from us and there is no guarantee of success or even action. ",
