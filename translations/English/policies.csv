#,armsexports,Arms Exports,"While controversial, some countries may begin selling weapons to the highest bidder as a source of revenue. Lower levels of this practice involve selling only to allies while high levels open the floodgates and sell to anyone who has the cash. Liberals dislike spreading more wepaons of war. Patriots are opposed to the idea as well, except for when it comes to selling to allies. The more advanced our military, the more we can make. "
#,natomembership,NATO Membership,"NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) is an intergovernmental military alliance of countries from the Americas and Europe. Created after World War II in response to future threats from around the globe, the alliance requires that other members come to the aid of any other member who is attacked. High levels of involvement will boost relations with other members, but will weaken the military benefit provided since you'll now be supplying it. "
#,elderlyinterneted,Elderly Internet Education Program,"The modern day version of the internet is still relatively new and many of our elderly citizens struggle to use it. Their lack of tech skills result in increased cyber crime and spread of fake news. By starting a program with the purpose of educating senior citizens on the use of technology and the internet, we can reduce some of these issues. "
#,immigrationenforcement,Immigration Enforcement Force,"In recent years, there has been an outcry from more patriotically minded individuals regarding the dangers that illegal immigration poses. To reduce the number of illegal immigrants living in the country, we can assemble an Immigration Enforcement Force that works around the clock to find those who are here illegally and deport them. "
#,unmembership,United Nations Membership,"The United Nations is an intergovernmental organization whose primary purpose is to further human development and keep the peace around the globe. The organization is supported through the financial contributions of its many nation-state members. The funds that we contribute to the UN will go towards assisting developing countries, enforcing human rights laws, and maintaining global stability. "
#,secretservice,Secret Service,"Being the leader of a nation typically entails making a lot of people angry. For those radical enough, this anger can oftentimes turn into violence. By creating a private guard of our nation's leadership, we will be able to prevent any kind of harm. We'll need a good intelligence network however, to make full use of these guardians. "
#,skilledimmigration,Skilled Immgiration Incentives,"All around the world, there is brilliance hidden in every corner. By setting up immigration incentives for the most highly-skilled individuals around the world, we can utilize the full-breadth of human capital available to us internationally. Foreign nations will likely disapprove of these measures at high levels, as it takes their talent from them. Patriots are likely to dislike this idea since they view it as taking jobs from our citizens. "
#,aliensearch,Search for Extraterrestrial Life,"For as long as man as been able to look up to the stars, we have asked ourselves the same question time and time again. Are we alone in the universe? Some see the search for extraterrestrial life as an essential scientific duty; a duty that would best be carried out by a government. This agency will scan through the cosmos to try to find a trace of whatever is, or isn't, out there. "
#,shuttleresearch,Shuttle Research Grants,"One of the largest impediments to space travel as it stands now is shuttle design. The space shuttles that are currently in use are lacking in numerous departments and are in desparate need of being brought into the 21st century. By supplying research grants, we can improve on many shuttle features including: core design, engine systems, life support, and more. "
#,privatespacesub,Aerospace Industry Subsidies,"Aerospace technology is an incredibly difficult industry to thrive in, especially when it comes to projects involving space and space travel. It may be many years or even decades before any of these companies start turning a profit. We can divert some of our assets to assist these companies as they navigate through the awkward, early-years of the space industry. "
#,lunarbase,Moon Base,"Ever since the United States landed on the moon in 1969, humanity has dreamed of a permanent presence on the moon. With the technology of the 21st century, it may finally be possible. Building a moon base would greatly decrease the cost of space travel, giving us a refueling platform for vessels. A lunar base would also allow us access to lunar mining industries, giving us a large number of energy and rare earth resources. "
#,spaceforce,Space Force,"A new age calls for a new branch of the military. By creating a space force, we will be solidifying our hold on space and future-proofing our armed forces. As more and more nations move upwards, it is likely that rivalries will follow them. Our space force may consist of military satellites, sensor equipment, asteroid interception tools, and potentially even combat vessels. "
#,openspacescience,Space Tech Global Research Agreement,"We're going to need all the help that we can get if we're going to push humanity towards it's rightful space in the stars. However, most countries around the world are struggling to get their space programs off the ground. By sharing everything that we know technologically in regards to space travel, we'll be opening up a new avenue of cooperation with world powers. However, this could keep us from ever truly having a technological advantage. "
#,banprivatespace,Ban Private Aerospace Programs,"Considered a drastic step by many, banning private aerospace companies in your country is a measure that can be taken to prevent the free-market from spilling into space. This policy will ensure that space is purely for scientific and government merit, allowing the rat race of modern life to stay contained to the Earth. "
#,gamblingtax,Gaming Tax,"One of the benefits that has been associated with the prospect of legal gambling is a ""Gaming Tax"". This tax would collect government revenue from any activity involving gambling. Those who oppose measures to tax the industry point out that it could wipe out a large amount of economic gains the industry is providing, and would also disproportionately affect the poor. "
#,prostitutetax,Sex Work Tax,"The sex work industry is yet another that has had taxation proposed around it once legalized. Opponents argue that the government shouldn't be making any revenue off of an industry as scandalous as this. Others also point out that the poor will be affected at a much higher level than those who have the funds to pay, thus creating yet another luxury tax. "
#,churchtax,Religious Institutions Tax,"As religion has made the transition towards business-like practices, many are calling for these institutions to be taxed like any other organization that rakes in a profit. While taxing megachurches and the like can result in a significant amount of revenue, it isn't likely to make the religious very happy. To stay operational, many may start drawing funds from other areas of operation. "
#,landtax,Land Value Tax,"Unlike traditional property taxes, a land-value tax does not take into account anything built on the land. It only taxes the value of the land itself. This leads to an incentive to build and develop on the land, which can cause growth in GDP and opens up further development in urban areas rather than having to move outward. The wealthy will be unhappy with this, as it is yet another tax on one of their greatest assets. "
#,tourismtax,Tourist Tax,"Some within our country have made calls for a tax on tourism, so that those who wish to visit are contributing to the country's wallet even more directly than they were previously. Patriots fully support such a tax, under the belief that those who visit should contribute to our country in return. Capitalists aren't as happy, seeing this as unnecessary meddling in a profitable industry. "
#,abroadtax,Earned-Income Abroad Tax,"Typically, the income that is earned by individuals who reside here but work in another country is taxed by the country that they are residing in, rather than ours. However, we can institute a policy in which we tax this income as well, earning revnue from our citizens who aren't residing within our country currently. This tax tends to disproportionately affect capitalists (who frequently travel the world for work) and self-employed people (many of whom are positioned in foreign countries). "
#,negativeincometax,Negative Income Tax,"While welfare is traditionally seen as less than desirable to capitalists, there exists another alternative to UBI and the welfare state. A negative income tax is a reverse tax. That is, if you make under a certain amount each year, rather than paying in to the system you will receive a payment proportional to what it takes to get to that aforementioned amount. It tends to reduce the threat of poverty traps as well as giving money only to those who truly need it. "
#,jobgurantee,Job Guarantee,"Working for the government is nothing new, but guaranteeing jobs goes beyond the necessities. A job gurantee can be put into place to ensure a certain number of employment positions for people across our country. This policy idea, while effective, is considered by many to be a dramatic solution to unemployment. By guranteeing these jobs at a livable income level, we can indirectly raise wages by increasing pressure on private employers. Less worries about employment will likely affect productivity, however. "
#,statementalhealth,State Mental Health Service,"In 2013 alone, mental illness cost the United States $201 billion in lost productivity. Beyond it's economic impact, mental health issues result in pain felt millions around the world each year. Typically, care for less severe mental health issues is relegated to the private realm. This leaves those who are most in need of help oftentimes having to go without care. By covering this care with government money, we can ensure individuals get the help they need. "
#,waterconservation,Water Conservation Program,"Booming population sizes in conjunction with environmental devastation has resulted in worries regarding the future of water availability. To prepare for this future, a water conservation program can be enacted to eduate our people about water conservation practices. A program such as this won't only result in lower water usage, it will also result in more environmentalists. "
#,nuclearsanctions,Nuclear Sanctions,"More nuclear weapons residing on it is strictly a negative for humanity and the planet. However, political pressures and inter-country conflict can result in some nations pushing to acquire nuclear weapons. To reduce nuclear proliferation and prevent mass destruction, we can enact sanctions against any nation currently pursuing the nuclear option. The more influence we have, the more successful this will be. "
#,middleeasttroopsstable,Troop Deployment: Stabilize Middle East ,"The Middle East is in crisis. To enforce order in this region and protect it's citizens, we must deploy our military forces. Troop deployment intended to stabilize may consist of aiding local governments, training foreign troops, and even outright invasion at high levels. The strength of our military will detemine the effectiveness of this campaign. "
#,middleeasttroopssecure,Troop Deployment: Secure Middle East,"While some may suggest that the Middle East needs to be stabilized, there are others who believe that we could likely benefit from the ongoing situation. By choosing sides in conflicts, aiding our allies, and capturing strategic assets in the area we can use our military might to come ahead. Expect the international community to dislike this move. The strength of our military will determine the effectiveness of this campaign. "
